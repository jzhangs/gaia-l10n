# l10n.js

The l10n.js lib used in Gaia, extracted from [mozilla-b2g/gaia](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/shared/js/l10n.js).

Please refer to
- [App localization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/B2G_OS/Firefox_OS_apps/Localization) - A detailed guide on FxOS app localization.

Gaia l10n derived a lot from original [webL10n](https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/webL10n). There's also [l20n](https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js), but it's rarely used (recommended from FxOS 2.5). Now l20n is also deprecated, the succeeded localization system  [Project Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/) is never used in B2G OS.

## KaiOS

[KaiOS](https://developer.kaiostech.com/) still uses `l10n.js` as its localization lib.
